# Changelog

All notable changes to `nftgeo` are documented here. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The running version is reported by
`nftgeo-update --version` and in the `Loaded` log line of each run.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- `nftgeo` operator CLI (installed alongside `nftgeo-update`):
  - `nftgeo check <ip>` - show whether an address is whitelisted, on the abuse
    list, or in a geo set, the rules that match it, and the resulting verdict.
  - `nftgeo status` - one-screen summary: version, last run, set sizes, live drop
    counters, abuse-feed cache freshness, and the next scheduled run.
  - `nftgeo apply` / `nftgeo version` wrap the update engine.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- Add `auto-merge` to the address sets so overlapping/adjacent entries no longer
  fail to load with "conflicting intervals" - which happened once `ABUSE_FEEDS`
  CIDRs were merged with AbuseIPDB single IPs, and could also affect a whitelist
  or geo target that mixed an address with a subnet containing it.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- `ABUSE_FEEDS`: extra plaintext IP/CIDR blocklists (e.g. FireHOL level1,
  Spamhaus DROP, blocklist.de, GreenSnow) merged into the same `abuse` sets, so
  existing `deny ... abuse` rules cover them. Feeds are fetched only when a rule
  targets `abuse`, and each feed's last good copy is cached per URL and reused on
  a download failure so an outage never shrinks the blocklist.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-05

First tagged release. Captures the current feature set and recent hardening.

### Features
- Declarative per-direction geo firewall for `nftables` (`in`/`out`/`fwd-in`/`fwd-out`).
- Match by country, region, literal IPv4/IPv6, CIDR, named groups, `any`, and the
  AbuseIPDB blacklist (`abuse`), with tcp/udp/sctp/icmp/icmpv6/esp/ah/gre.
- Opt-in AbuseIPDB blocking with retained state across download failures.
- `WHITELIST` of always-allowed addresses, plus `WHITELIST_HOSTS` for
  hostname-based whitelisting that is re-resolved on every run (fail-safe, with
  retention through DNS failures).
- Twice-daily refresh via a `systemd` timer; atomic, validated ruleset loads.

### Fixed / hardened
- Ship `rules.conf.example` without an active rule so a fresh install cannot
  lock out SSH.
- A single unresolvable country no longer aborts the whole update; deny-only
  empty geo groups are skipped, allow-backed ones still fail safe.
- Serialize runs with a lock so the timer and a manual run cannot race.

### Notes
- Documented that `allow <dir> any - <target>` closes the entire direction.
- Refreshed stale `systemd` unit descriptions.
